# TextEncryptor
Simple Windows Forms app for encrypting and decrypting text data based on Strategy pattern

I build this app quite long ago to practice freshly learned <strong>Strategy pattern</strong>.
You can see in the code how I utilize ITextWorker interface to call the same function with different realizations from different classes. In other words, I used <strong>polymorphism</strong> on practice, one of the paradigm of object-oriented programming.
